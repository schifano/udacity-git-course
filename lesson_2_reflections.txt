What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Notes:

If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset. For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but don’t want it to be committed yet, run git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt and the file will be removed from the staging area, but it will still be in your working directory.

git diff
With no arguments, git diff will compare the working area and the staging area. 

git diff --staged
changes made that are staged

git reset --hard
reset anything in working directory or staging area
careful, because you haven't committed these, cant get them back

detached head? run
git checkout master

detached means, looking at a commit that is not labeled with a branch name

git branch, shows branches
git branch [args], creates a new branch

remote branch, did not create yourself

--word (this is a flag)

git log --graph --oneline master coins

Reachability


If you delete a branch, you're essentially deleting the label for that branch. The commits are still there, but they are unreachable, so it's like they are not there. You want to merge your branch into the master before deleting a branch. Commits merged into master may be shown as interleaved based on the time they were created.

git merge master coins (automatic merge)

git show, show difference between a commit and its parent without knowing what the parent was.

If you want to merge branch2 into branch1, you can simply git checkout branch1 and then type git merge branch2. The only reason to type git merge branch1 branch2 is if it helps you keep better mental track of which branches you are merging.

-v stands for verbose, to output more information
git remote -v

git remote origin
(if your repository is empty)

clone from a repository, already creates a remote.

git fetch

git pull origin master =
	git fetch origin
	git merge master origin/master

git log origin/master
	origin/master won't show commits that are present on your local master but not GitHub.

Fast-forward merge
	can you reach a from b? then you can fast forward
